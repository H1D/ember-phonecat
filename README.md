# AngularJS Phone Catalog Tutorial Application Coded in Ember.js

## Overview

This repo was [inspired from this tutorial](http://204nocontent.me/i-coded-the-angular-tutorial-app-in-backbone-and-it-took-260-more-code) which was inspired by [AngularJS PhoneCat Tutorial App](http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial). I figured we might as well have an ember one as well. I'll need to go back and make branches of the steps though.
